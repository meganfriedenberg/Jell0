# Jell0
Physics simulation for mass-spring system modeling a cube inside a cornell-box force field. Project for CSCI 520.

- [Physics](https://github.com/meganfriedenberg/Jell0/blob/main/Jello!Sim/physics.cpp) contains how collisions are handled with walls, force fields, and self collisions. Both Euler and RK4 integrator options are available.

- [Jello](https://github.com/meganfriedenberg/Jell0/blob/main/Jello!Sim/jello.cpp) initializes the 3 springs used by the system: structural, shear, and bend springs.
